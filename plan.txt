Trying to predict weather f1 drivers finished or not a race. 
Binary classification
Loaded data. 


10K samples
31 features
18 features are categorical. Trying to use one hot encoding (perfect)
Clean data...
Some categorical features have as many as 12. (brand name)

others less than 10. 
Since feature looks at end result directly (even though, some datapoints have zero AND finished race), highly recommend to get rid of it. 
Feature is a result of the prediction/or an after the fact data. 

if times allows, do 2-5 models with this points feature, but wont be considered a models. 


Narrative:
+ Car manufactorers can be interested in this since they could find the factors that influence if they finish or not
+ Betting markets and such predictions. 

Performance metrics
+ Binary classification problem.
Choose one accordingly, make sure to prioritize your goal:
Accuracy, Presicion, recall, f1, fbeta, Custom metrics as well.
Models
Binary classification  Total models: ~85 models. 
+ Logistic regression (include feature selection AND lazzo regularization 30 models)
+ Random Forests ( for feature selection) (#number trees, threshold amount, etc). 15 models. 
+ Neural networks (architecture, #layers, #nodes, activation functions, so on) 30 models. 
+ SVM changing parameters (10 models, changing number of features, and or uncertainty).
